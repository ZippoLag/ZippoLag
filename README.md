### ~~Hello~~ Hi World!

I'm Sebasti√°n, software developer, Kendo instructor and (recently) dad from Rosario, Santa Fe, Argentina. Most of my projects are either private or frankenbabies that never got pushed to a public repo, so: I'm sorry if my profile looks a bit bare and stale.

Speaking of my code and projects, I try and keep my skillset varied, but I find myself always returning to the comfort of .Net / C# as my default (I've enjoyed many-a-crazed season of pure-JS development, even some hobbyst game development for a while).

I've found that I also enjoy learning human languages, currently looking for a timeslot to learn ASL on top of my Spanish, English and (bare) Japanese. I enjoy writing quite a bit as well, though I seldom publish anything.
